		<p> Hi, Welcome to my site. My name is Jillian Krebsbach and I am a chef that specializes in making health supportive, plant-based meals that taste great and help you feel your best. </p>

		<p>After graduating from the Natural Gourmet Instutite, the nation's premier health-supportive culinary, I have cooked in some of New York City's best restuarants from the large James Beard award-winning farm to table vegan-inspired ABCV by Michelin star Chef Jean-Georges to the delicious, market driven-dishes in the heart of the West Village at Chef Dan Kluger's Loring Place. I also have event catering experience, and I am trained and certified in food safety. </p>

		<p>I will customize your meals according to your dietary needs and preferences. I can create a satisfying and balanced dairy-free, gluten-free, vegetarian or vegan menu. I am committed to using the freshest ingredidents, including organic produce, whole grains, grass-fed meats, and wild, sustainable seafood.  I love combining seasonal food with interational flavors and spices, from Southeast Asian to Mediterranean.</p>

		<p>I will save you valuable time--menu planning, grocery shopping, cooking, portioning and packaging meals, and cleaning up afterwards.  I can create a week's worth of all-natural meals and snacks for your busy family, or a plated four-course dinner for a special occasion.  It's up to you! </p>

		<p>In addition to personal chef services, I am also available for private cooking classes and events, from casual brunches to elegant cocktail parties.  Thanks for visiting. Sign up for my newsletter with periodic kitchen tips, recipes and to stay connected! </p>
